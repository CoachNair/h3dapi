## Overview ##

H3D API is an open-source, cross-platform, scene-graph API.
H3D is written entirely in C++ and uses OpenGL for graphics rendering and OpenHaptics for haptic rendering.



## H3D Releases ##

This is the 2.0 version of H3D API.
Released on: Mon, 10-Nov-2008

The main difference between H3D API 2.0 and 1.5 is that the haptics part is now built on SenseGraphics own haptics library called HAPI.
HAPI is also OpenSource and can be downloaded in the releases.
HAPI 1.0 is required to build H3D API 2.0.
